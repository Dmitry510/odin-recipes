  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Yummy! This soup is great! I make this soup when I make an Italian dinner for guests and 
    everyone wants the recipe. It's also great on those cold winter days where suppers call for
    a hot and delicious soup. A combination of sausage and vegetable in a beefy broth. This may
    be made a day in advance. Tastes even better the second day. Enjoy!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound Italian turkey sausage, casings removed</li>
    <li>2 carrots, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas)</li>
    <li>2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat a pot over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey
      sausage in the hot pot until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir carrots, onion, mushrooms, 1/4 cup parsley, and garlic into sausage. 
      Cook and stir until onion is soft, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour water, garbanzo beans with liquid, beef bouillon cubes, and sage into sausage 
      mixture. Bring to a boil, cover the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until carrots
      are tender, about 10 minutes. Skim and discard any accumulated fat.
      Season with salt and pepper; garnish with remaining 4 teaspoons parsley.</li>
  </ol>
